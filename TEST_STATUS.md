# Test Status Report

## Current Test Failures

### pkg/kubernetes-mcp-server/cmd (7 failures)
- TestConfig/* - Tests expect logging output but get version output due to --version flag
- TestProfile/* - Similar issue with --version flag interaction
- TestListOutput/* - Similar issue with --version flag interaction
- TestReadOnly/* - Similar issue with --version flag interaction
- TestDisableDestructive/* - Similar issue with --version flag interaction

**Root Cause**: Tests are using `--version` flag which causes early return before log messages are printed. These tests need to be refactored to not use --version when testing config logging.

### pkg/mcp (5 failures)
- TestResourcesDelete - Pre-existing failure
- TestServer_clustersList - ClusterManager not initialized in test
- TestServer_clustersSwitch - ClusterManager not initialized in test
- TestServer_clustersStatus - ClusterManager not initialized in test
- TestServer_clustersRefresh - ClusterManager not initialized in test

**Root Cause**: Cluster tests don't properly initialize the clusterManager field in the Server struct. These tests were likely broken when multi-cluster support was added.

### pkg/kubernetes (0 failures)
âœ… All tests passing

## Summary
- Total failures: 12 (not 13 as originally reported)
- 7 in cmd package (test logic issue with --version flag)
- 5 in mcp package (4 cluster tests + 1 pre-existing)
- 0 in kubernetes package (all fixed)

## Next Steps
1. Fix cmd tests by removing --version flag from config tests
2. Fix cluster tests by properly initializing clusterManager in tests
3. Investigate pre-existing TestResourcesDelete failure
